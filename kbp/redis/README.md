# Example app: Real-time data analysis using Kubernetes, Redis, and BigQuery

This directory contains an example [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes) app that shows how to build a 'pipeline' to stream data into BigQuery.
The pipeline uses [Redis](http://redis.io/).

Documentation for this example can be found on the Google Cloud Platform site:
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/real-time-analysis/kubernetes-redis-bigquery

See also a related app, in the `pubsub` directory, which uses [Google Cloud PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs) instead of Redis.
